# Burger-Shack
Create a program to order food from a burger shack. The store sells 3 varieties of
burgers

a. Veg Burger, which contains potato patty, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, onions, ketchup, and mayonnaise.

  i. Cost to the store = Rs 50
  
  ii. Price charged to customer = Rs. 75
  
b. Non-Veg Burger, which contains meat patty, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, onions, ketchup, and mayonnaise.

  i. Cost to the store = Rs 75
  
  ii. Price charged to customer = Rs. 120
  
c. Vegan Burger, which contains potato patty, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, onions, and ketchup.

  i. Cost to the store = Rs 80
  
  ii. Price charged to customer = Rs. 135

The store takes 5 minutes to prepare the veg burger, 10 minutes to prepare the non-veg burger, and 4 minutes for the vegan burger. The burgers for each consumer are created sequentially. Although, different consumers’ orders are prepared parallelly so each consumer’s “time to burger” is independent of other consumers. One user can order “n” number of burgers. Find the time needed to create the order for each consumer. Also, print the total profit of the store by the end of the day.

Using the OOPS concept to design the program needed for this. Write unit test cases where possible to improve the reliability of the code. Write comments in the code to improve its readability and properly name variables as per their use.
